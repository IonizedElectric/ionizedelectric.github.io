<p><br>We have coded a wellbeing app, called Aurora. We chose this name because it creates an aura of happiness (hopefully), and also because it sounded cool. We thought that there were enough apps out there to help with your physical health, but too few focusing on your psychology. The ones that were already out there were not as versatile as ours, often aiming to deal with a specific issue. Ours provides a degree of diagnostics, helping you to identify problems by taking your input and putting it into clearly defined graphs and charts. Our app can intelligently put forward cures and suggestions from the community, as well as a few pre-programmed cures we wrote. You can submit suggestions, see your history, and more. See <a href="design-concept.pdf">our design concept</a> for more details.<br><br>We made this app with the Ionic framework, allowing us to code our app in familiar HTML, CSS and JS and easily turn it into apps for IOS and Android, helping compatibility and styling to remain consistent. Most apps need to be coded once for one program, then entirely re-done for the other, but using a framework helps us avoid this problem. We created a server on a raspberry pi to store the various suggestions submitted by the community, using Ubuntu server.</p>
